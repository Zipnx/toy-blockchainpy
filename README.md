# Toy BlockChain

This is a rework of a similar test chain I made a while ago, which's code is
borderline unreadable (let's be real, this will end up like that again)

Built to be easy to understand how a blockchain
works, in conjunction with PoW and such

## Usage:

For now, run sample code in the ./samples/ directory.

Will add more stuff when i got time (TXs & UTXOs, maybe a proper chain)

As of now blocks can be created and mined to correspond to their selected difficulty
